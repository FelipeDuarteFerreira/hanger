### A graphical tool for ETL process orchestration and data quality

## How it works
Hanger's main goal is to create and orchestrate process chains in Jenkins, graphically defining dependency between processes and running dependent processes according to defined rules. Because it is an orchestration tool for ETL processes, but not limited to this purpose, Hanger is able to perform validation of the ETL process result through user-defined SQL statements and execute SQL or SHELL Script actions according to the validation result.
